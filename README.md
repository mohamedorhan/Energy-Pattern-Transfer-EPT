## Abstract

Energy Pattern Transfer (EPT) is a fundamentally new power delivery architecture that separates *energy mass–flow* from *waveform semantics*.  
Instead of transporting instantaneous peak power through resistive infrastructure, EPT transports only a compact spectral pattern describing power needs, while each node locally reconstructs the waveform using shallow distributed storage.  
This enables **60–80% transmission loss reduction** compared to traditional AC/HVDC systems.

This repository contains:
